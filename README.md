# Ethereum Laboratory


In this repo I intend to add all my experiments related to contract development in ethereum for distributed ledger stuff. I'm basing mostly all my code in [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org) documentation, specially from [here](https://www.ethereum.org/dao) and [here](https://www.ethereum.org/token). I'm deploying the code in Ethereum wallet application, using virtual sandbox space they have left for developers.
